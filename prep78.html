The main difference between the content sared in chapter 7 and chapter 8 are the way you can interact with different figures. Chapter 7 mostly focuses on the simple statistics numbers like standard deviation and mean. It shows how the figures are going to have less data usually most likely sample sized. Chapter 8 focuses on how to read data that is in more of a populaition, but chapter eight talks more about the distributions and skews of a set of data.

Using diffferent indexes allows you to manipulate how you see the data. You can adjust the range of data you see to promote a differeent conclusion than wha tall of the data might show.The downside to this is that if on eis taking different indexes for each obeservation, if not kept track of, the data ccould end up seeming like a whole different set of data because it varys so often.  using subseasonal chart to look at different things are useful because you can see trends durning different time periods. by segmenting the seasons you cna make trends based on that, but the downside to that is the seasons are not always discrete. Sometime winter comes earlier or later so the seasonal times vary based on what data you are using. The last visualization method would be to use a logrithmic approach. By looking at the graph in these terms, one can take big data and make sense of it by relating with logs. The only thing with this is if you dont thave a lot of data and or data that moves exponentially or logrithmiclly, then the data will not produce anything significant when looking at the graph in this way. This method may only refer to a certain trend of datam so it wont be as usable in many situations.
